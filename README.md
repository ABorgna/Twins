# Twins

Game made in Rust for the [Weekly Game Jam](http://www.weeklygamejam.com/),
which definitely didn't made the deadline. 

Currently this repository gives home to many drafts and experiments with rust.
One of those is `brillito` which is an idea for some visuals and `mursten`
which is a proof of concept of an abstract game engine. 

## Howtorunthis?

Currently you will need rust installed and will have to compile the executable
yourself. Sounds complicated but is pretty simple actually.

In a terminal run:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh  # This will prompt for installation options
git clone git@github.com:Jbat1Jumper/Twins.git twins
cd twins
cargo run --bin twins  # Use `--bin room` to run the project for the graphic systems course of the ECI 2018 
```

If you are on windows you may need to download rust from https://rustup.rs/
